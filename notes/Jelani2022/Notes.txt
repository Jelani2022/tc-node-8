--The Internet--
IP addresses - the internet protocol assigns numbers to each devise as a way to identify
wifi is accessed thru unlicensed spectrum- Electromagnitic Frequencies
Cellular is accesed thru cell service territories using licensed spectrum that is auctioned to cellular providers
Cloud computing refers to computer experiences enabled thru internet services
    working remotely instead of from the local device
    lets users have a more seamless and convient experience w/ tech by allowing the cloud to handle technical details (file sync, software updates...)
data is transfered thru packets
    packets can hold up to 64kb of data
    packets are transfered from users device to the server by breaking them up to transmit and put back together upon reaching the destination

SSL (secure socket layers) is how web connections are securely maintained (encryption)
Domain name gives users the ability to browse the web by named addresses rather than their true IP address

The internet is basically a wire connecting servers. Servers are special computers holding code.
personal computers are not directly connected to the internet, they are connected to ISP (internet service proivder) which are connected to the internet
information being transfered are broken up into smaller packets that are put back together when it reached its destination
everything connected directly or indireclty are assigned IP addresses ( computers, cell phones routers...)
anywhere 2 or more parts of the internet itercect there is a router
routers direct packets around the internet
    say your packets are in a wrapper
    your ip address is the first layer on that packet
    as the packets move along thru routers, it collects those IP addresses until it gets to the server
    same thing in reverse following the IP addresses until it gets back to your computer


---Front end Development---
3 core coding languages - HTML , CSS , & JavaScript
--HTML--
Hyper Text Markup Language
language that determines how documents and web pages are displayed in a browser -> BUILDING BLOCKS OF ANY WEBSITE
Defines Semantic Structure
all text on page should be given meaning thru syntax as to how or what the text represents
--CSS--
Cascading Style Sheet
language that determines howw a document created in HTML is styled (colors, font style, layout, and responsive features)
improve the presentation/look of HTML elements
--JavaScript--
allows you to change CSS and HTML elements on your site after it has been loaded, giving you the ability to make your site more interactive and engaging for users
dynamic, interpreted programming language that can add interactivity to a website

Front end languages live and operate in the browser
each of these languages performs seperate functions that work together to determine how the page is structured(HTML), how it looks(CSS), and how it functions(JavaScript)
